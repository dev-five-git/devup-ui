If you want to use Devup UI Components, you need to **install** it.

```bash
npm install @devup-ui/components
// or
yarn add @devup-ui/components
// or
bun add @devup-ui/components
```

Note: If you encounter `Cannot run on the runtime` error, make sure the include option is properly configured for your bundler.
